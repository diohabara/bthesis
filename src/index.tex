% overview of the research topic
\chapter{Abstract} \label{section:abstract}
In recent years, several tools have been developed to enhance the productivity of programmers.
In particular, tools for generating code have attracted a lot of attention, and program synthesis is a research field that supports this development.
Program synthesis requires specifications with which users tell a computer what they want to achieve.
In the case of logical expressions, it is difficult for programmers who are not skilled in math.
With natural language, computers may not be able to understand the meaning, and the intention may not be conveyed correctly.
This paper examines the use of a type and effect system as a specification that is easy to understand by humans and computers alike.
Types are familiar to programmers who use statically typed languages.
Many users are unfamiliar with effects, but they can describe the internal behavior of functions and are easy to understand if designed properly.

In Chapter \ref{section:introduction}, I discuss the motivation for this research, what program synthesis is, and existing methods.
I explain my proposed method in Chapter \ref{section:method}.
I present in Chapter \ref{section:experiment} the results obtained by the proposed method and evaluate them.
Chapter \ref{section:conclusion} concludes with a summary of the results and evaluation, as well as future issues.
